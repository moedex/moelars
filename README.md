# moe-LARS

**Moe Limited but Accurate Response System.** A local-models-only typed-decision engine.

State plus typed questions go in. Calibrated probability distributions come out, in one
forward pass per question, with no text generation. The answer space is limited to the
options you declare, which is what makes calibration and zero structural errors possible.

moe-LARS is wire-compatible with the System One HTTP API. Point any existing System One
client at it by changing the base URL.

```
POST /v1/systemone
GET  /v1/models
```

Three primitives from the System One shape, one moe-LARS addition:

| primitive | question | answer |
|---|---|---|
| `noul` | is this true? | `noul`: P(yes) |
| `choice` | which one of these? | `choice`, `probabilities`, `confidence` |
| `score` | which ordered level? | `score` (may be fractional), `legend`, `probabilities`, `confidence` |
| `multi` | which of these apply? | `probabilities` per option, `selected` |

moe-LARS extensions, all opt-in under a `moelars` request key: permutation-averaged choice
answers with an `order_sensitivity` metric, declared constraints between nouls,
abstention below a probability margin, evidence spans by leave-one-out ablation, and evidence fusion: named numeric features per
noul (`moelars.features`), combined with the model's logit by a logistic fitted in `calibrate`.

## Quickstart

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run moelars serve --backend mock            # no model needed, deterministic demo answers
```

```bash
curl -s localhost:8600/v1/systemone -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "state": "Help! My payouts have been failing for 3 days.",
  "questions": {
    "department": {"type": "choice", "instructions": "Which team should handle this?",
                   "criteria": {"billing": "Payments, payouts", "technical": "Bugs, outages"}},
    "is_urgent":  {"type": "noul", "instructions": "The message conveys urgency"}
  }
}'
```

With a real model on Apple Silicon:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev --extra mlx
uv run moelars serve --backend mlx --model mlx-community/Qwen3.5-4B-Instruct-4bit
```

The MLX backend caps MLX's buffer cache at 4 GB (`MOELARS_MLX_CACHE_GB` changes it). Uncapped, varied prompt lengths grew it to about 100 GB within a few hundred requests.

Or any GGUF model anywhere:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev --extra llamacpp
uv run moelars serve --backend llamacpp --model ./models/qwen3.5-4b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf --template chatml
```

Use it from the official System One SDKs by swapping the base URL:

```python
from typesafe_sdk import Choice, Noul, TypeSafeClient

client = TypeSafeClient(api_key="local", base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8600")
r = client.system_one(
    state="I was charged twice.",
    questions={"refund": Noul("Is the customer asking for money back?"),
               "team": Choice("Which team?", criteria={"billing": None, "technical": None})},
)
print(r.nouls["refund"].noul, r.choices["team"].choice)
```

## Calibrate on your own data

Raw model logits are not calibrated. Fit temperatures on a labeled set, then serve with them:

```bash
uv run moelars calibrate --backend mlx --model <model> --data my_labels.jsonl --out calibration/mine.json
uv run moelars serve     --backend mlx --model <model> --calibration calibration/mine.json
uv run moelars eval      --backend mlx --model <model> --calibration calibration/mine.json --data my_test.jsonl
```

`eval` reports accuracy, expected calibration error, Brier score, and the coverage you
can automate at a 5% error budget. The JSONL format is in `evals/README.md`. Nouls get
a Platt fit on the raw yes-minus-no logit, which can move a biased model's decision
boundary; choice and score get a temperature. Rows may carry `"features": {"name": value}` for nouls; `calibrate` then also fits an evidence fusion, used
whenever a request supplies the same features in `moelars.features`. `examples/molar_triage/` walks through
this end to end on a small hand-labeled dental inbox.

## Train a decision head (Tier B)

The backbone stays frozen. A small zero-initialized pointer head learns a residual on
the model's own label logits from cached features, in seconds, and serves through the
same engine:

```bash
uv run python -m moelars.train.build   --out data/train
uv run python -m moelars.train.extract --model <model> --records data/train/*.train.jsonl --out data/features
uv run python -m moelars.train.residual --train data/features/train.npz --heldout data/features/heldout.npz
uv run moelars serve --backend mlx --model <model> --head checkpoints/pointer_head.npz --projection data/features/projection.npy
```

Details and the data policy are in `src/moelars/train/README.md`.

```

## Results

jev-bench, 22 configs, 200 test rows each, per-config calibration fitted on validation.
Jev's numbers are quoted from jev-bench's published jev-1.13.0 run on full splits.

| configuration | macro acc | Brier | ECE |
|---|---|---|---|
| Jev (published) | 0.733 | 0.349 | 0.113 |
| Qwen3-4B zero-shot | 0.662 | 0.404 | 0.088 |
| Qwen3-4B + LoRA | 0.731 | 0.317 | 0.074 |
| Qwen3-30B-A3B zero-shot | 0.680 | 0.372 | 0.079 |
| **Qwen3-30B-A3B + attention LoRA** | **0.752** | 0.295 | 0.060 |
| Qwen3-30B-A3B + attention-plus-experts LoRA | 0.751 | 0.286 | 0.072 |
| both 30B adapters averaged (simulated from row dumps) | 0.765 | 0.282 | |

- A paired bootstrap over test rows puts the attention LoRA 1.9 points above Jev (95% CI
  0.7 to 3.1) and averaging both adapters 1.3 above it alone (0.7 to 1.9). Neither covers
  seed variance; a second seed is in `CLOSEOUT.md`.
- civil_comments (calibrated 0.930, the majority baseline) is worth about 1.8 macro points;
  without it the attention LoRA is 0.743 against Jev's 0.733.
- LoRA regresses stsb (0.425 to 0.350 on the 30B) and mmlu (0.780 to 0.750).

Full tables in `evals/RESULTS.md`, newest section last.

## Status

Pre-alpha, closing out to v0.1.0 (`CLOSEOUT.md`). The mock backend and the HTTP contract
are tested. The MLX backend has been run on Apple Silicon with Qwen3-4B, Qwen3.5-9B and
Qwen3-30B-A3B, zero-shot, with Tier B heads, and with LoRA adapters. The llama.cpp
backend is written against its library's documented API and still needs a hardware pass.
See `DESIGN.md` for the architecture, the reasoning, and the roadmap.
