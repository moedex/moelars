"""Several LoRA adapters on one base model, swapped in place between passes.

The model gets LoRA layers for the union of the adapters' keys (an attention-plus-experts
adapter covers an attention-only one). Each adapter's weights stay in memory, with zeros
for keys it does not adapt, so a LoRA layer it lacks adds nothing. `use` reassigns the
LoRA arrays without copying, so switching adapters costs no model pass. Adapters must
share rank, scale and adapted blocks, which is what `moelars.train.lora` writes by default.
